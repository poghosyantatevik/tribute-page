                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>1926</strong> - born in his parents' apartment at 200 Hamlet Avenue in Hamlet, North Carolina.</li>
                        <li><strong>1955</strong> - Coltrane was freelancing in Philadelphia while studying with guitarist Dennis Sandole when he received a call from trumpeter Miles Davis.</li>
                        <li><strong>1957 </strong>- Coltrane worked with Thelonious Monk at New York's Five Spot Café, and played in Monk's quartet, but, owing to contractual conflicts, took part in only one official studio recording session with this group.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>1959</strong> - Coltrane recorded Giant Steps, his first album as leader for Atlantic which contained only his compositions.</li>
                        <li><strong>1961 </strong>- Coltrane's contract with Atlantic was bought by Impulse!.[41] The move to Impulse! meant that Coltrane resumed his recording relationship with engineer Rudy Van Gelder, who had recorded his and Davis's sessions
                            for Prestige. He recorded most of his albums for Impulse! at Van Gelder's studio in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey.</li>
                        <li><strong>1962</strong> - Dolphy departed and Jimmy Garrison replaced Workman as bassist. From then on, the "Classic Quartet", as it came to be known, with Tyner, Garrison, and Jones, produced searching, spiritually driven work.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>1965 </strong>- Coltrane showed an interest in the avant-garde jazz of Ornette Coleman,Albert Ayler,and Sun Ra. He was especially influenced by the dissonance of Ayler's trio with bassist Gary Peacock,[55] who had worked
                            with Paul Bley, and drummer Sunny Murray, whose playing was honed with Cecil Taylor as leader. Coltrane championed many young free jazz musicians such as Archie Shepp,[56] and under his influence Impulse! became a leading free
                            jazz label.</li>
                        <li><strong>1965</strong> - Coltrane was regularly augmenting his group with Sanders and other free jazz musicians. Rashied Ali joined the group as a second drummer. This was the end of the quartet. </li>
                        <li><strong>1967</strong> - Coltrane died of liver cancer at the age of 40 on July 17, 1967, at Huntington Hospital on Long Island.</li>
                    </ul>
